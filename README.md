# Shakspeare GPT (Trying out Karpathy's GPT module )
A simple, minimal character level language model trained on Shakespeare's works, inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's](https://github.com/karpathy) youtube video ["Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out."](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=jsH0b1V7lZXlUtiG)

## Overview
This project implements a tiny GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) from scratch using only NumPy and PyTorch. The model is trained on [Shakespearean text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt) to generate human like text in the same style.

## Features
- Character-level tokenization

- Transformer block with attention mechanism

- Training loop from scratch

- Text sampling/inference

- Minimal external dependencies
